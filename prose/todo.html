  <h2>TODO</h2>
  <p>
   I plan to try to make a minimum viable demo first
    and then come back with more ideas.
  </p>
  <p>
  I make no mention yet of security,
   as that will be retrofitted into version 2
  </p>
  <p>
   It would be nice to replace this documentation
    with a Pseudowhiteboard drawing
    containing the same information.

  <p>
   I'm starting to write the
    <a href="./server.html">server</a>,
    so there are TODO list items on that page.
  </p>
  <p>
   The server is to the point where I need to think about writing the clients.
   There are TODO items on the
    <a href="./desktop.html">desktop client</a>'s
    documentation page.
