   I'm not a lawyer, and I can't afford to hire one

   At a later time, I may relax these terms.
   It's a lot of work to get licensing right,
    and I don't want it to slow me down.
   It's easier to grant a less restrictive license later
    than it is to revoke one,
    so I'm starting with the strictest terms I can think of
    in the hopes that I'll come back and open this up for freer use.
