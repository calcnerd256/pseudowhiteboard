   Connect a laptop or desktop computer to a projector or large TV
    and open Pseudowhiteboard in your Web browser,
    so everyone can see the big picture.

   The desktop version of the interface shows the URL
    where the mobile users can find the mobile version of the interface.

  <h3>TODO</h3>
  <p>
   I need to decide what spectator mode should look like and implement it.
   I imagine it will include a fully-zoomed-out view of the whole canvas,
    with color-coded rectangles on it for the mobile users' locations.
