   This software is written by Montana Rowe,
    in hopes that his coworkers find it useful.
   You can e-mail Montana at

   You can also fork this repo on GitHub
    and send pull requests or create issues.
   But be careful, as
    <a href="./contributing.html">
     my source code contribution policy
    </a>
    is a little unorthodox.
   To play it safe, you should express your intent when sending me any help.
