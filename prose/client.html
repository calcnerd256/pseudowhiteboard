  <h3>client</h3>
  <p>
   Initial support is planned for two kinds of rich clients:
    JavaScript-heavy browser interfaces running on desktops and phones.
  </p>
  <h4>desktop</h4>
  <p>
   Connect a laptop or desktop computer to a projector or large TV
    and open Pseudowhiteboard in your Web browser,
    so everyone can see the big picture.
  </p>
  <p>
   The desktop version of the interface shows the URL
    where the mobile users can find the mobile version of the interface.
  </p>
  <h4>mobile</h4>
  <p>
   Each meeting participant connects to the meeting
    with the Web browser on his or her smartphone.
