  <p>
   If you want to send me code to include in this project,
    you need to understand that this is not copyleft software.
   My choice to publish the source code does not grant anyone
    <a href="./license.html">a license</a>
    to use it.
   When you send me a pull request, you are granting me the right
    to use the contents of your pull request in any way I see fit.
   If you wish to do otherwise, please
    <a href="./contact.html">contact me</a>
    in advance so I can agree to your terms or reject them.
