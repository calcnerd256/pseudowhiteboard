  <p>
   If you want to send me code to include in this project,
    you need to understand this:
    this is not copyleft software.
   This project is mine, and the source code is currently
    "all rights reserved" by me.
   When you send me a pull request, you are granting me the right
    to use the contents of your pull request in any way I see fit.
   If you wish to do otherwise, please
    <a href="./contact.html">contact me</a>
    in advance so I can agree to your terms or reject them.
  </p>
  <p>
   Furthermore, there is no warranty of any kind, express or implied.
   If you use my software without my permission, that's on you.
   I'm not a lawyer, and I can't afford to hire one
    just to write a license that captures my intent.
   Nothing here is intended as legal advice.
  </p>
  <p>
   At a later time, I may relax these terms.
   It's a lot of work to get licensing right,
    and I don't want it to slow me down.
   It's easier to grant a less restrictive license later
    than it is to revoke one,
    so I'm starting with the strictest terms I can think of
    in the hopes that I'll come back and open this up for freer use.
