   The browser gets its
   <a href="./client.html">client-side code</a>
   from a webserver.
  </p>
  <h3>server</h3>
  <h4>static client code</h4>
  <p>
   The browser-based clients depend upon the webserver
    to supply their application source code.
  </p>
  <p>
   The server needs to be able to serve up static files.
  </p>
  <p>
   Currently, it can serve up static
    <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>,
    but no other
    <abbr title="Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions">MIME</abbr>type.
  </p>
  <h4>plugin-based architecture</h4>
  <p>I plan to evolve the design into a framework with plug-ins.</p>
  <h4>chat-ops as a database</h4>
  <p>
   Communication between clients looks like like an IRC chatroom.
  </p>
  <h3>server software</h3>
  <p>
   The webserver is written in
    <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">nodeJS</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
   For some reason, I'm running version
    <a href="https://nodejs.org/docs/v0.10.25/api/">0.10.something</a>,
    even though the stable release is version 6.10.3.
   <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fox_and_the_Grapes">Whatever</a>,
    I didn't want to use much in the way of features anyway.
  </p>
  <p>
   The source is in
   <a href="../src/serve.js">../src/</a>.
  </p>
  <h4>running</h4>
  <p>
   To run the webserver, cd into the src directory and
    <pre>nodejs ./serve.js</pre>
    then visit the URL it prints to stdout.
  </p>
  <p>
   I'm assuming you know how to install NodeJS.
   If you don't,
    <a href="./contact.html">contact me</a>
    to let me know
    that this part of the documentation needs expanding.
  </p>
  <h4>TODO</h4>
  <h5>chatopsdb</h5>
  <p>
   The server will need to broker messages between clients.
   For the MVP, we can just append to the log and fetch the whole log.
