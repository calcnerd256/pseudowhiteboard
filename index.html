  <h1>Pseudowhiteboard</h1>
  <p>
   A browser-based
    <abbr title="zooming user interface">ZUI</abbr>
    for collaborative, multiscale drawing.
  </p>
  <h2>browser-based</h2>
  <h3>server</h3>
  <h4>plugin-based architecture</h4>
  <p>I plan to evolve the design into a framework with plug-ins.</p>
  <h4>chat-ops as a database</h4>
  <p>
   Communication between clients looks like like an IRC chatroom.
  </p>
  <h3>client</h3>
  <p>
   Initial support is planned for two kinds of rich clients:
    JavaScript-heavy browser interfaces running on desktops and phones.
  </p>
  <h4>desktop</h4>
  <p>
   Connect a laptop or desktop computer to a projector or large TV
    and open Pseudowhiteboard in your Web browser,
    so everyone can see the big picture.
  </p>
  <p>
   The desktop version of the interface shows the URL
    where the mobile users can find the mobile version of the interface.
  </p>
  <h4>mobile</h4>
  <p>
   Each meeting participant connects to the meeting
    with the Web browser on his or her smartphone.
  </p>
  <h3>Web</h3>
  <p>
   Pseudowhiteboard isn't a particularly good citizen of the World Wide Web.
   <noscript>
    Thank you for browsing with JavaScript disabled.
   </noscript>
   Unfortunately, while this page currently works without JS,
    the main application eventually won't &mdash;
    at least, the
     <abbr title="minimum viable product">MVP</abbr>
     won't.
  </p>
  <h2>ZUI</h2>
  <h3>zooming</h3>
  <p>
   Mobile users will be able to pinch-zoom and pan around an unbounded canvas.
  </p>
  <p>
   The desktop interface will zoom out to contain the entire drawing.
  </p>
  <p>
   Mobile users can bookmark viewports to return to later.
   They can also summon each other or the desktop to bookmarked viewports.
  </p>
  <h2>collaborative</h2>
  <p>
   Multiple meeting participants can add content to the scene at the same time.
   Everyone can see everything everyone draws.
  </p>
  <h2>drawing</h2>
  <p>
   Mobile users can create content by adding strokes to the drawing.
  </p>
  <h3>multiscale</h3>
  <p>
   Strokes are rendered with a thickness and opacity appropriate
    for the zoom level of the viewport in which they were drawn.
  </p>
  <h1>TODO</h1>
  <p>So far, no code has been written yet.<p>
  <p>
   I plan to try to make a minimum viable demo first
    and then come back with more ideas.
  </p>
  <p>
  I make no mention above of security,
   as that will be retrofitted into version 2
  </p>
  <p>
   It would be nice to replace this document with a Pseudowhiteboard drawing
    containing the same information.
