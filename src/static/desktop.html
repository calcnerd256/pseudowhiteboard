   This will be where the desktop client will live.

  <h2>TODO</h2>
  <p>
   The first thing I need to to is
    provide instructions to the mobile clients
    on how they can connect.
  </p>
  <p>
   I plan to use this at work.
   I'll create a hotspot with my FirefoxOS phone.
   Then I'll connect my PocketC.H.I.P. to the hotspot.
   PocketC.H.I.P. will run the webserver.
   I'll tell my boss how to connect his laptop to the webserver.
   His laptop will then display this page,
    which will tell my coworkers how to connect from their mobile phones.
   They'll need to join my access point on my phone.
   Then they'll need to visit the appropriate URL.
